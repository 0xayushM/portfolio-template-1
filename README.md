## Component-JSON Mapping 📊 

Wondering how to tailor your portfolio's content? Let's demystify it with a groovy flow chart that links each component to its JSON buddy:

- **Profile Section**: Jazz it up in `profileData.json`
- **Quote Section**: Express yourself in `quoteData.json`
- **Skills Section**: Amp up skills in `skillsData.json`
- **Projects Section**: Showcase projects in `projectsData.json`
- **Work Experience Section**: Share experiences in `workExData.json`
- **Carousel**: Spotlight your images in `carouselData.json`
- **Side Navbar**: Connect on socials via `socialData.json`
- **Highlight Color and Background image**: Change the color of the **highlighted content** or change the **background image** in `globals.css` 

    ```
    :root {
        --themeColor : #FBBF64;
        --hoverColor: #ffdfae;
        --boxShadow : #a98043;
        --hoverBoxShadow : #e1ae62;
        --themeColor2 : white;
        --themeTextColor : white;
        --themeTextColor2 : black;
    }
    ```
